# Initiolization-controlled-BigSleep

A stirpped down version of the BigSleep NoteBook edited to support initiolization around latent spaces of a chosen class or mix of classes. This simple change allows better convergence for related prompts and more appealing results. This notebooks is optimized to run on GoogleColab enviorment, but with very few changes it would work in any other.
